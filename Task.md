We have pool. It can be filled by 2 pipes. <br>
First pipe fills it for `5h`. <br>
Second pipe fills it for `6h`. <br>
For how many hours the pool will be filled if they work together? <br>

Pipe 1 fill the pool 1/5 per hour
<br>
Pipe 2 fills the pool 1/6 per hour

If Pipe 1 and Pipe 2 work together they will fill 11/30 for 1h

1/5 + 1/6 = 11/30
11/30 * X = 1
X = 1 * 11/30
X = 2.73
