We have pool. It can be filled by 2 pipes. 
First pipe fills it for `5h`.
Second pipe fills it for `6h`. 
For how many hours the pool will be filled if they work together?

Pipe 1 fill the pool 1/5 per hour  
Pipe 2 fills the pool 1/6 per hour

If Pipe 1 and Pipe 2 work together they will fill 11/30 for 1h

1/5 + 1/6 = 11/30
11/30 * X = 1
X = 1 * 11/30
X = 2.73
